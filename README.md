# EcoSnap Api Project

# ツ The Aim of This Project

<p align="justify">In this project, my aim is to reach the coordinates of some parts of bad things that must fixed in Hacettepe University Beytepe campus after taking photos with EcoSnap application.</p>

<p align="justify">To do my midterm project, firstly I downloadede "EcoSnap" applicaton from Google Play Store and singed up in application. Then, signed up in the "Postman" application. I got the user id with following tutorial. After that, I took photos from the Beytepe campus using the application. The things I took were photos that had the desired features, such as broken pavement, weak wifi, wrong park. While examining the EcoSnap application, I realized that I could follow my friends and access the photos they took. Therefore, in my project, I took the data of the photos with certain coordinates taken by some of my friends in my project, via Python. Last, I visualed with "folium" library and completed my project.</p>
